# Logger

This package includes a custom logger for the project.

Functions are exposed for logging messages easily; it is imperative that these
functions are used throughout the project to maintain a standard in log
messages.

If necessary, the `logWriter` can be edited so that in addition to writing to
stdout, it can also write to a file or send the logs to a server like Better
Stack or New Relic.
